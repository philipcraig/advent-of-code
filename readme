Downloading your input manually
cargo aoc input will download an input and store it in input/{year}/day_{day}.txt.

Please note that by default, we're taking today's date as the argument. Of course, you can change this using : cargo aoc input -d {day} -y {year}

Running your solution
cargo aoc will run the latest implemented day, downloading your input beforehand. It will show you the result, and a short summary of how well it did perform.
